MNAR implies that the likelihood of an email address being missing depends on the value of the email address itself or some unobserved variable. In this case:\n","Some entries have email addresses, while others do not. This discrepancy suggests that the absence of email addresses may be related to the email addresses themselves, such as stores choosing not to provide them. It's possible that certain types of stores or certain regions are less likely to provide email addresses, and this information is not explicitly captured in the dataset.\n","\n","b. **Department is Missing At Random:** The absence of department information might not be random; rather, it could be influenced by various observable factors. For example, factors like the type of store, its location, or the products it specializes in could impact whether department information is provided. Stores focusing on specific product categories, such as clothing or beauty, might be more inclined to offer department details compared to general-purpose stores. Additionally, larger stores might have more standardized data collection processes, leading to fewer missing department entries. Therefore, it's essential to consider these factors when analyzing the missingness of department information. Arguably, this could be Missing Completely at Random as well, as MCAR suggests that the missingness is entirely random and unrelated to any observed or unobserved variables. In this case, the missingness of department information doesn't seem to follow any discernible pattern in the provided subset of data. There's no apparent relationship between the missingness of department information and any other variables in the dataset, such as store income or country.\n","\n","c. **Country is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR):** In this case, there's no systematic reason for the missingness of country information. The missingness is entirely random and unrelated to any observed or unobserved variables. Here's why it's classified as MCAR: The absence of country information doesn't appear to follow any discernible pattern in the provided subset of data. There's no apparent relationship between the missingness of country information and any other variables in the dataset, such as store income or department."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
