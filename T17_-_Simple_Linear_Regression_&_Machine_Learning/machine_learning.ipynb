Answer here\n","* 2.1 Classification algorithm as this involves assigning emails into two categories (promotion or social), which is a classification problem.The output is discrete, either promotion or social.\n","* 2.2 Regression algorithm. Stock predictions are made using price which is a continuous numeric value based on historical data and trends, making it a regression problem. Regression algorithms are used when the output variable is a continuous value.\n","* 2.3 Classification algorithms are suitable when the output variable is a category or a class label. In this case, visual features of images can be used as input for classification algorithms like conv olutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.\n","* 2.4 Classification and regression both. This case involves predicting the probability of a patient having a disease , which is a classification problem. The output is binary (having the disease or not having the disease), making it approprioate for classification. however, logistic regression can be used to base predictions on other factors, such as medical history and test results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b6f8UETG64hH"},"source":["3.
